# For vs While Loops -- Practice Problems
**(Included as a repl assignment in GWC PDX Class)**

## Question 1: Filtering Numbers

Take a list, say for example this one:

```master_list = [1, 47, 2, -10, 5, 3, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]```

Write a program that, saves all the elements of master_list that are less than 20 in a new list, called small_list.

HINTS:

1. Create a variable called max_number and assign it 20 since that is our max
2. Don't forget to initiate your new list, called small_list!
3. Use a loop to iterate through your master list! You decide if you are going to use a for loop or a while loop!

**Follow up problems:**
* Sort small_list so you start from smallest to largest number!  Assign the sorted list to a new variable, called sorted_small_list.
 * Print sorted_small_list.
 * Print the sum of all the numbers in small_list.
      **HINT:** To calculate the sum of a list, use sum( listname)
* If you used a for loop, try the problem using a while loop!
* If you used a while loop, try the problem with a for loop!

**Starting code in repl assignment:**

```python
master_list = [1, 47, 2, -10, 5, 3, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

# Create a variable called max_number can assign it to 20

# Initiate your new list, called small_list

# Write your loop!  Are you using a for or a while loop?


# Print small_list


# Print the sum of small_list




# OK! NOW, Try it again but use the other kind of loop!
# Comment out your code and start over down here so you don't lose it!
```
